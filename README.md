# hello-word
Hey! My name is Yusuf. I am a fourth-year PoliSci undergrad at BOUN. I love learning new things and coding is one of them! Particularly, I wanna acquire the necessariy skill sets for Data Science.
I think I always have a passion, deep-inside-me, for data but I guess I have been waiting for the right moment, never too late!
